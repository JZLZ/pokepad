# PokePad - Ionic Angular App

This project is a mobile app built with Ionic and Angular that uses the public PokeAPI to display Pokémon data.  
The main screen shows the Pokémon's name and image, while the details screen presents additional descriptions and related images.  
Pagination was implemented to improve the usability of Pokémon lists and descriptions.  
Dependency injection is used to manage services and keep the code clean and maintainable.  
Users can mark Pokémon as favorites in a dedicated list.  
The app layout is responsive and adapts to both portrait and landscape device orientations.  
I followed best practices with clear, frequent commits to document development progress on GitHub.  
Third-party libraries were used to simplify development while keeping the code organized.  
Components are modular and reusable, following Angular’s recommended design patterns.  
This project is open for improvements and includes basic documentation for easier understanding.
