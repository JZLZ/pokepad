# PokePad API - Ionic + Angular

This project is a small mobile web app built using Ionic and Angular.  
It consumes the public RESTful API [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) to list and explore Pokémon data.  
On the home screen, users can view a paginated list of Pokémon with names and images.  
Each Pokémon can be clicked to access a details screen with height, weight, types, stats, and abilities.  
Pokémon can also be marked as favorites, which are saved locally using localStorage.  
I used Angular services with dependency injection to manage API calls cleanly.  
The UI is fully responsive for both portrait and landscape orientations.  
I followed modular design, with clear separation of logic and view components.  
The code is committed in small and clear steps to reflect development progress.  
Future improvements may include unit tests, animations, and offline caching.
